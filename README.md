# Smartthings Homebridge Plugin

This is a smartthings plugin for Homebridge.  This requires no access to the legacy smartthings app, and doesn't
require a lot of work to install.  It will discover devices automatically as well as unregister devices that are removed
from your smarttthings network.  This is currently under development.
## New in version 1.5.22
* Support for Quiet mode for air conditioners
## Fixed in version 1.5.20
* Fixed discovery of devices issue where some fans were set up as lights
## Fixed in version 1.5.19
* Handle multi component devices that don't have a "main" component supported by plugin
## Fixed in version 1.5.17
* Handle shades that don't support shadelevel but do support switchlevel.  FIXED
## Fixed in version 1.5.16
* Handle shades that don't support shadelevel but do support switchlevel
## New in version 1.5.15
* Support for optional capaiblities declaration
* AirConditionerService adds fan oscillation switch and optional mode switch only if supported by device's capabilitites
## New in version 1.5.14
* Support for air conditioners optional modes (i.e., Sleep, Speed, WindFree, WindFreeSleep)
* Stop logging warning if battery is low
* Issue with thermostat service making homebridge crash.  If we can't get a status from the thermostat we will return zero for temp to
avoid crash.
## Fixed in version 1.5.13
* Handle invalid response to "getLevel" call in lightservice.  There is a Zooz driver that 
does not return a valid response causing homebridge to fail.
## New in version 1.5.12
* Updated dependencies
## Fixed / New in version 1.5.11
* Added air conditioner support thanks to lucaponzanelli
* Fixed window shade support (wasn't showing up)
## Fixed in version 1.5.10
Fixed window shade support including webhook support for the window shade service.  Added polling paramter for window shades, 
'PollWindowShadesSeconds'
## Fixed in version 1.5.9
* Removed the check for the apostrophe as it caused more issues than solved.  With this change, if you try to add a device
that has a label like "bill's iphone" it may not get excluded, but it solves other issues.
* Update dependencies
## Fixed in version 1.5.7 - 1.5.8
* Issue in some cases where a device label is a number or some non-string type, there would be a failure when setting up the devices.
This occured after release 1.5.2.
## Fixed in version 1.5.6
* Handle missing device label (name)
## Fixed in version 1.5.5
* If smartthings returns an invalid status value on a sensor device, it will retry 5 times before removing the service.

## Fixed in version 1.5.4
Corrected status handling for mult-component devices.
## Fixed in version 1.5.3
* Fixed double push issue on buttons

## New in version 1.5.2
* Support for multi-component devices
* Support for buttons - requires subscription to the webhook service.  See the announcement [here](https://github.com/iklein99/homebridge-smartthings/discussions/141).
<p>
IMPORTANT: Multi-button devices get loaded into the home app with the button numbers not always in the order that they
are on the device.  Also, some devices, like the Aeotec Fob Remote will show 1 more button than there are on the device.
This is because the device reports a main component with a button along with one component for each button.  You will find
that in this case, one of the buttons in the Home app acts as a master, so it will fire for any of the other buttons. 
</p>
<p>
In order to see which buttons are which, you can observe the animation in the Home app as you press buttons so you know how to set up
actions per button.
</p>

## Fixed in version 1.5.2
* Ignore device names with a single quote will not match with the device name coming in from SmartThings due to character code
conversion.  This has been fixed.
## New in version 1.5.1

## New in 1.4.8
Support for Leak (water) detectors.
## New in 1.4.7
Rearchitecte plugin to handle multi service devices.  Changing the way services are added based on capabilities reported in

Switches are polled now, so updates will flow into home kit.  Also some refactoring of code to make more efficient when polling
devices with several associated characterstics / services.

Fixed another lock state issue.

## Fixed in version 1.1.13

## Fixed in version 1.1.3

## Fixed in version 1.0.2

Config UI now works.  

## Device types supported

Currently, the following have been implemented, because that is what I have access to in my home.  Supports: Switch, Lightbulb, Fan,
Garage Door Opener, Locks and Window Shades that support the WindowShadeLevel command.

## How to configure

You will need to create a Smartthings personal access token.  You can do that here: https://account.smartthings.com/tokens.  Create a
new token and make sure it has all of the device permissions, and if you want to use the Ignore Locations feature, you must include the List Locations (r:locations) permission.  Save your token and add it to the configuration.
<br>
By configuring the WebhookToken, the plugin will attempt to connect to the SmartThings
Webhook Server that we're running and wait for events.  This will result in 
the plugin ignoring the poll settings as polling will not occur.
<br>
This section should be added to the platforms array in your config.json file, but you can now edit using the config UI:
<pre>
        {
            "Name": "Smartthings Plugin",
            "AccessToken": "INSERT YOUR PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN HERE",
            "WebhookToken: "INSERT WEBHOOK TOKEN HERE",
            "BaseURL": "https://api.smartthings.com/v1",
            "GarageDoorMaxPoll": 40,
            "PollLocksSeconds": 15,
            "PollDoorsSeconds": 15,
            "PollSensorsSeconds": 5,
            "PollSwitchesAndLightsSeconds": 15
            "platform": "HomeBridgeSmartThings",
            "IgnoreLocations": [
                 "My location 1",
                 "My location 2"
             ],
            "IgnoreDevices": [
                "Device to ignore 1",
                "Device to ignore 2"
            ]
       }
</pre>
The "IgnoreLocations" array may be omitted.  This array can be used to specify location names, as confogured in the Smartthings app.  All of the devices in these locations will be ignored and not added to Homebridge.  If you add any IgnoreLocations after you had previously started Homebridge with this plugin, those devices will be removed.  You may remove this section to have them added back in.  IMPORTANT: your API token must have the "r:locations" permission in order to ignore locations.<br>

You need to restart Homebridge when you make changes to this file.
